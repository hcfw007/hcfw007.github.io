It's been a while. I've written something but maybe not the right time to put it online. I might still have some negative thoughts but I’d like to embrace it, since I always love this kind of thoughts.

It’s my 28th birthday today. Happy birthday to me. I’m not a big fan of birthday but I’m opposed to celebrate it. It’s kind of sad considering I’m still living with my parents. But this is China, house pricing doubles almost every 24 months. It is impossible for one normal 28-year-old to pay for one’s own downpayment. Since they don’t like my girlfriend, I don’t want their help on it. They have so much desire to control my life. In fact I’m really tired of living with them. I tried to rent a room to live by myself for one and half years. The life is ok actually, but I can barely save up any money. The living cost in Beijing is too much.

I’m actually not sure where my future lands. Jessica wanted to have kids in the future, so it is impossible to give up my Beijing citizenship. Thus I cannot earn some money and go back to buy a house in my hometown. I hate to have others controlling my life, but I also believe that who pay the bill should have some say on it. So it really bothers me a lot.

I know that hard work does not always pay back. But there is no better way for a normal guy like me. So I’ll try my best, and wish god pity me.
