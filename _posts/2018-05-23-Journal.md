I might go to Panjin to see Jessica this weekend. Although I do like to be noted a week prior about her schedule, so far it’s not OK so I guess I’m the one out of my comfort zone. At last she could still use the extra income from FB (not facebook). Too bad.
Suddenly I’m getting interested in English calligraphy now. For all these years I have been regarded as an English expert among my friends and it’s the first time I’m thinking to learn something about the English language.
I set up a blog on Github Pages. I might consider moving all my public journals there.
