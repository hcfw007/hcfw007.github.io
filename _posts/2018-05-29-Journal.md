Cavaliers fought back and won at TD Garden. Such an amazing performance by LeBron James. He played for 48 whole minutes and fought hard from the beginning to the end. Even in the last minutes, he still could got an and one 1 vs 2 and a great chasing block. As a team which lost the two best players it was quite an effort for them to play at this stage. Those rookies (not all exactly first year in NBA) have given all they got.

I wrote on Zhihu.com that I might be watching one of the greatest personal performance in NBA playoff history. I never really like LeBron (I still don’t like him), but I also alway agree that he is one of the best players in NBA history. It is a hard year for LeBron. He might be partly responsible for some of the bad contracts own the team but on court he is still the man  who dominates. What ever it takes, and he surely gave it all.

In Houston, Western Conference Final is also ongoing and I’m watching it right now. It’s a pity Paul and Iguodala still cannot play but the game is quite intense. In the first half Rockets had the lead but Warriors turned things around once again in the 3rd quarter. Indeed both Rockets and Warriors have a better chance to win title than Cavaliers but they won’t do it without a fight. I’ll write about it if I have time tomorrow.
